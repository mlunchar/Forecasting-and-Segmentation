# Forecasting-and-Segmentation
This project was made as an assignment for Practicum100 Data Analyst course for mastering Machine Learning techniques for Forecasting and Segmentation.

From machine learning techniques in this project we implement Logistic regression and Random Forest Classifier models for Churn Prediction, and K-means model for users' clustering. Additionally, we used VIF technique to confirm feature multicollinearity, and we used a dendrogram plot to estimate the approximate number of clusters. 

Project description:

In this project we're going to analyze customer profiles from Model Fitness gym chain and come up with a customer retention strategy. For this purpose we will predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer, draw up typical user portraits by selecting the most outstanding groups and describing their main features and analyze the factors that impact churn the most.

Project structure:

1. General look at the data. Taking a look at the given data.
2. EDA and Data preprocessing. Checking for possible anomalities in data and fixing them.
3. Modeling. Churn prediction and users' clustering, using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models, as well as K-means.
4. Overall conclusion and advice for business.

Additional information:

* The project was created in Jupyter Notebook, so to run it you should have Anaconda installed. It has a Table of Contents for easier navigation.

* When downloaded, the data has to be stored in the same folder with the notebook.

This project was created by Mila Lunacharska, in April 2022.
